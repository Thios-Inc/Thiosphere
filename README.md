# Thiosphere
The frame to all the spaces



[![[Thios-logo-color.png]]](https://thiosphere.com)
A ====Thiosphere==== is made from two ====concentric==== spheres, using the least number of sides possible, to create a second place to efficiently nurture life. 

Cheap to build yourself with locally sourced materials, or flat packed and shipped to you, each Thiosphere creates a ====compact, climate controlled space====, isolated from the ground, so it can stay warmer in winter and cooler in the summer.  

> "The fewest number of sides means the ====fewest number of parts===="

> "====Thios====" is derived from the number ====two==== in Greek
> Two = δύο = "thio" ("th" pronounced like “the”).

====Two can fit in one parking spot,==== providing harvests year round, anywhere, with very little energy requirements due to its designed efficiencies, and closed loop ecosystem.

Leveraging aeroponics, community sourced growing knowledge and local consumers; one person, acting like a AirBnB super host, could manage multiple parking spots for local consumers, providing fresh, sustainable and organic produce, ====without the carbon footprint====.
